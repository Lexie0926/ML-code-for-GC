Computational and data driven-assisted optimizing and understanding of the multiple stage extraction process for polysaccharide and secondary metabolites from natural products

Run our code:
1. Run GRA2.m to extract features of extraction factors.
2. Run BPNN.m and RBFNN.m to conduct regression equation fitting for each observation.
3. After all observations are fitted, NSGA-â…¡ is going to perform for multi objective optimization, while Pareto front is about to get.
4. Finally, run TOPSIS.m to get the best solution from Pareto front.

NOTE:
1. Parameters of these code should be modified according to the data from the experiment.
